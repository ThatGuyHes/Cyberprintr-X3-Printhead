# Cyberprintr-X3-Printhead
From video: https://youtu.be/V20B5KyDLhE

This system was inspired by Stratasys 3d printers that lift and cool down the nozzle when switching between Tool 0 and Tool 1. Custom machined parts may not be obtainable for everyone so feel free to mod the heck out of this design. [Don't forget to share ;)]

Also added an LGX-Lite direct extruder because the PVA had too much drag in the bowden. 
And 4010 blower fans instead of the 2510 radial fans. 

You will also need to install 1 bowden extruder. I recommend the Mobius 4 from Voron. Also a wipe and purge bucket will improve oozing issues if you add one.

This design is very experimental! No firmware included!
